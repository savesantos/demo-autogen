Enter your response: Great! I'll start by gathering some more details about your preferences for the new car. Here are a few questions to help narrow down your options:

1. **Budget**: What is your budget range for the new car?
2. **Fuel Efficiency**: Are you looking for a specific miles per gallon (MPG) range, or is any good fuel efficiency acceptable?
3. **Car Type**: Do you have a preference for car type, such as sedan, SUV, hatchback, or hybrid/electric?
4. **Safety Features**: Are there any specific safety features that are particularly important to you, such as lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, or automatic emergency braking?
5. **Brand Preferences**: Do you have any preferred brands or manufacturers, or are you open to considering all options?
6. **Usage**: How do you plan to use the car? (For example, commuting, family trips, weekend adventures, etc.)
7. **New vs. Used**: Are you only interested in new cars, or are you open to certified pre-owned options as well?

Once I have this information, I can search for the best options that match your preferences!

We often talk about driving range in regards to electric vehicles, but it can be an important metric for gasoline-powered cars as well. When you're on a road trip, how far you go between fillups can be a pivotal factor for planning your stops, and generally the longer the range the better. We test vehicles on a 75-mph real-world highway loop, calculating a range number based on fuel tank capacity and the vehicle's fuel-economy result. We also measure observed electric range when running only on battery power. What follows is a list of the plug-in hybrids we've tested with the most overall range when you combine gasoline and electric power. Mazda's first plug-in-hybrid for the U.S. is a three-row SUV with a new powertrain that produces a total of 323 horsepower. Using a 2.5-liter inline-four gasoline engine and an electric motor, the CX-90 PHEV offers good fuel economy, performance, and EV range\u2014especially for such a large vehicle. The XC90 has been on the market for nearly a decade now, but it's received numerous updates over the years. One of these was a recent upgrade for its plug-in-hybrid powertrain, which now uses more powerful electric motors and a larger battery pack."}]
