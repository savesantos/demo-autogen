Plan a 6 day trip to someplace in Europe this summer for a couple in Lisbon, Portugal. It can't be Prague, Budapest and Rome. If possible the destination should have a beach involved or an amuzement park. Our budget is limited to a maximum of 700€ per person. Offer insigths on budget requirements with fligths included by searching on the web. Provide references to information taken from the web.
---------- PlanningAgent ----------
To plan your 6-day trip to a European destination that includes beach activities or an amusement park, I'll break down the tasks into smaller subtasks and delegate them to the appropriate agents.

1. web_search_agent : Search for affordable destinations in Europe that have beaches or amusement parks, excluding Prague, Budapest, and Rome, and within a budget of 700€ per person, including flights.
2. local_agent : Once a destination is confirmed, find local activities, attractions, and accommodations that fit the budget and will enhance the couple's experience.
3. travel_summary_agent : Compile and summarize the complete travel plan, including destination details, itinerary, budget breakdown, activities, and accommodations.
4. user_proxy : Prepare to approve the final travel plan once all tasks have been completed.

I'll wait for the web_search_agent to complete the search and provide the findings before moving on to the next steps.
