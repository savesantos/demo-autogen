## Subfolders

### End-to-End Tests
- **Location**: `/tests/e2e`
- **Purpose**: Contains tests that cover the entire application flow from start to finish. These tests ensure that the application works correctly in a real-world scenario.

### Functional Tests
- **Location**: `/tests/functional`
- **Purpose**: Contains tests that validate the functionality of the application from an end-user perspective. These tests simulate user interactions and check if the application behaves as expected.

### Integration Tests
- **Location**: `/tests/integration`
- **Purpose**: Contains tests that verify the interactions between different components or systems. These tests ensure that the integrated parts of the application work together correctly.

### Load Tests
- **Location**: `/tests/load`
- **Purpose**: Contains tests that measure the performance of the application under various load conditions. These tests help identify performance bottlenecks and ensure the application can handle the expected load.

### Performance Tests
- **Location**: `/tests/performance`
- **Purpose**: Contains tests that measure the performance characteristics of the application. These tests help identify bottlenecks and ensure the application meets performance requirements.

### Security Tests
- **Location**: `/tests/security`
- **Purpose**: Contains tests that focus on identifying security vulnerabilities within the application. These tests help ensure the application is secure against potential threats.

### Smoke Tests
- **Location**: `/tests/smoke`
- **Purpose**: Contains tests that verify the basic functionality of the application. These tests are designed to quickly check if the application is working as expected after a deployment.

### Unit Tests
- **Location**: `/tests/unit`
- **Purpose**: Contains tests that focus on individual components or functions. These tests are designed to ensure that each part of the codebase works as expected in isolation.

## Conclusion

Each subfolder within the `/tests` directory serves a specific purpose in the testing process. By organizing tests into these categories, we can ensure comprehensive coverage and maintain a high-quality codebase.

## Additional Resources

### Common
- **Location**: `/tests/common`
- **Purpose**: Contains common utilities and configurations used across different types of tests.
